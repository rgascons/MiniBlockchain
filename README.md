# MiniBlockchain
I'm creating a toy Blockchain to learn and figure things out.

# Run the Node
1. Open the solution in VS 2020, with .NET 6 as target
2. Hit run and enjoy! The endpoints are `/mine_block` `/get_chain` and `/validate`

# Run the Wallet
1. Simply run the Wallet solution by hitting run in VS
2. Navigate the command line to send coins to any address
